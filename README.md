### 🎯 **From Concept to Reality**

Friendship? Here it only becomes **THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ART OF BETRAYAL**!

- **Why such simple damage?** → We designed **DEEP PSYCHOLOGICAL TACTICS AND MENTAL TORTURE**! Not just physical damage, but **DELAYED DAMAGE TO KEEP YOU ON EDGE**, **KEY MALFUNCTION TO PARALYZE YOU IN DESPAIR**, **RANDOM EFFECTS TO LET FATE MOCK YOU**! This isn't a game, this is **TOTAL DEMOLITION OF YOUR PSYCHOLOGICAL DEFENSES**!

### v1.1.0-hotfix - "Emergency Fix: End Death Drop!" 🚨🔧⚡
