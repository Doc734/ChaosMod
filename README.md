### üéØ **From Concept to Reality**

After watching these two videos, we were deeply shocked and immediately set out to create this **ULTIMATE PAIN AMPLIFIER**:

Watch your most trusted friends **STAB YOU IN THE BACK FOR THEIR OWN HEALING**, experience **TEAM DAMAGE SHARING** that makes everyone **WAIL TOGETHER IN HELL**, plus the **MYSTERIOUS SCAPEGOAT MECHANISM** where some unlucky soul **SILENTLY BEARS EVERYONE'S PAIN**! Friendship? Here it only becomes **THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ART OF BETRAYAL**!

- **Why such simple damage?** ‚Üí We designed **DEEP PSYCHOLOGICAL TACTICS AND MENTAL TORTURE**! Not just physical damage, but **DELAYED DAMAGE TO KEEP YOU ON EDGE**, **KEY MALFUNCTION TO PARALYZE YOU IN DESPAIR**, **RANDOM EFFECTS TO LET FATE MOCK YOU**! This isn't a game, this is **TOTAL DEMOLITION OF YOUR PSYCHOLOGICAL DEFENSES**!
